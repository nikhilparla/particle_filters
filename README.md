# particle_filters
Code examples from the Particle Filters lesson in Udacity CarND
Also add the exercise problems from Markov Localization chapter

### essense of the particle fliters 
It is an implementation of the Bayes rules just like the kalman filter. 
Checkout the summary picture in the repo which describes how the code realizes the particle filter theory 

### Particle Filter Implementation
 - First is the initialization step where we take an initial estimate with GPS sensor.
 - e1_pf_cpp_impl.cpp - check out the comments at the top of file to see what is being implemented
